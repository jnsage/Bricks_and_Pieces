The final output of this will be a .csv, ultimately used in a [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jared.sage/viz/BricksandPieces/BricksandPieces). The output of this notebook will be random each time. The .csv filesfrom this notebook used in the Tableau dashboard are found in the \"CSVs\" folder in this repo under \"theme_sample_set_list1\",\"theme_sample_set_list2\", and \"theme_sample_set_list3\". This notebook will generate \"theme_sample_set_list\" as an example of a sample generated by this notebook. \n",
